# UI-redesign

The website I picked for this project is https://www.thco.is/
I chose to redesign the landing page and the About us page https://www.thco.is/um-okkur/

In my Figma document there should also be two screenshots of these pages before the redesign.

After browsing the website, these were my overall concerns:
- The grey colored font does not have enough contrast against the white background.
- The landing page feels quite overwhelming and "messy". The content on the page lacks breathing space. 
- There doesn't seem to be a font style system. I saw a few different font types being used on the same page.
- It is hard to discern the hiearchy of information. What is the most important thing on each page?

My main goal was to keep the original content/focus of the pages as much as possible, but still elevate the look. I wanted it to look more "airy",
less chaotic and more harmonious.

Process:
I started by sketching up a rough wireframe of each page on paper, and then refined those in Figma. I then moved on to making prototypes and added 
content/ final tweaks. 

Overall changes:
- I changed all the font to black and used Roboto as the font style, as it looks very clean and readable. 
- For accent color I took the color of the logo and use that in various hues throughout the pages.
- All the pictures are from the website itself.

DETAILS

Landing page:

Nav bar:
- I used an abbreviated version of the logo in the top left corner. I basically took the favicon and made that be the logo. The first reason for that is the
  original logo is REALLY big and I thought it took to much space from more important features of the nav bar. Secondly, the logo contains crucial info such as
  address and phone number (it also contains a web address for a now defunct website). Because the logo is an image, users with screen readers cannot "read" this
  information. I wanted to make the site more accessible by adding that info in text form in the footer of the page. Having all that info both in a giant logo in the
  header and footer seemed like overkill.
- On the original page the search bar is in the footer, which I thought was not very user friendly so I moved it up to the nav bar.


Hero section: 
- On the original page there is a picture banner in a slideshow style. I thought the animation was too fast on it and the placement was off. So in my redesign
I took a more scaled back approach with a simple picture and and a button next to it that would take you that product on the site. An option for this would be to
have the user be able to swipe or click to another picture/product.
- Underneath we have banner/border with the brands the company sells. These are originally in a banner at the bottom but I thought it might be interesting to
 update the look of the banner and use it to create a division between the hero section and the rest of the page.
 
Features section:
 - On the original page there is a "news" section at the bottom which seemed like an odd choice to me, because it is basically advertising product/services.
  I reworked this section to give it more space and fill out the page better. And there the company could advertise new items, sales etc.
  
Footer:
 - There is a logo that advertises the company's 70 years in buisness, I kept it as I think it's a nice part of the company image. I took it as is
    from the site. It is very pixelated and weird, I know, but I didn't want to use my limited time to change it up in paint/photoshop.
 - The "special request" button was on the original page next to the "news", I thought it made more sense to have it in the footer.

About us page:
- Looking at the original page there is a grid with highlight info and some general history underneath. I put these side by side to make the highlight info pop
  more and be easier to view at a glance
